I began work on this project during my first couple of weeks working at Parker-Hannifin Co. During my internship, I was assigned to re-write an outdated web application using ASP.NET MVC Framework, Entity Framework, Razor View Engine, and C#--technologies I have never used before. To help build the skills necessary to complete the project I assigned, I began working on "Wolf" in my free time. I initially set out to create an application that allowed users to get basic stock information by symbol. I was able to accomplish this by reading articles and watching Yahoo Finance tutorials online. 

This small project allowed me to develop a foundation of skills that I used to develop larger applications during my internship. This project went untouched until recently when I decided to begin work implementing basic portfolio optimization principles that I learned in one of my statistics courses. 'Wolf' is far from perfect and it still contains some of the code that Visual Studio provides as a template for the web application. I plan to resume work on the project and complete the portfolio optimization functionality in the near future. This project is not much of a programming achievement, however, it speaks to my interest in the fields of statistics, finance, and computer science.
